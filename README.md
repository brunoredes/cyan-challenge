## technical test to Cyan;


### Tech

Cyan farm uses the following techs:

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) - As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
* [PostGIS](https://postgis.net) - PostGIS provides spatial objects for the PostgreSQL database, allowing storage and query of information about location and mapping.
* [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* BRModelo - Database modeling software
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
* [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) - The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.
